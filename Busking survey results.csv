All those rules about so many metres from here and so many meters from there are just crazy-making ideas. My delightful busker may be your busker-from-hell.  

Perhaps we need a simpler more self-managing scheme:

Think of this: 

-Every busker must have a city designed app on a smart phone.
-The app would:
   -allow busker to buy a desired amount of busking time per day.
   -monitor their precise location
   -green-light busking for a limited period at a given location, then
   -issue a red-light alert to the busker when purchased time is up, or
when time-at-current location is exceeded, or busking at a prohibited location is occuring, or number-of-buskers-at-a-location exceeds regulations (first-in buskers are protected at a location until their time-at-location is up or their total time  is up.)

Any peace officer can ask to see a busker's app. If it is red-lighted, the busker gets a ticket.)

Of course with an app, fines could be automatically charged to a busker's account (and be paid automatically from the busker's on-file credit card.)

Fines would be charged at an growing scale as the time in the red zone increases.

There are vanishingly few sites that meet this criteria in most of the commercial areas where such activity would likely be centred (e.g. Whyte Ave).  Forcing smokers and buskers to fight for these limited spots is counterproductive and likely to result in resentment and/or non-compliance in many circumstances.

Some businesses may have an ideal spot for a busker to set up, and may even welcome such activity.  Forcing the busker to move from these spots is again counterproductive, and contrary to the stated goal of making busking a positive experience.  

Should a business decide that they do not want a busker near their entrance, they should be able to ask them to move at least 5 m away, but it should not be a mandatory distance.

With alley way entrances, again this would depend on the site.  There are many alley ways where ideal sites for busking would be located in close proximity to an alley (such as in the parking lot of a business, especially if the business is closed).  10 meters is also an extremely large buffer for an alley.  Vehicles should not be entering or moving through an alley at greater than 20 kph in any circumstances.  3 m would be a more appropriate buffer distance.

Most boulevard situations would need to have buskers on the inside ""track"", but in some areas there may be sidewalks with large enough boulevards that busking could be allowed there.  Hopefully future developments, with more emphasis on walking promenades and the like will have more room for such activities.  The bylaw should not have such an ingrained arbitrary bias.  Perhaps a minimum width of the busking area would be a better measure (e.g. at least 2 m).",Male,Employed full-time (30+ hours a week),,Car/truck/Van as DRIVER,,Walk,,"$60,000 to $79,999",University undergraduate degree,EVANSDALE,3,45-49

Let me break it down for you. It cannot occur on or near a corner; that's when people stop for lights and actually have a chance to look at a busker. Cannot occur during a festival when the roads are blocked off or anything because they can't be near this road, this light, this alleyway, this doorway so - really they cannot be near anything. Cannot be energetic or creative since they have to stand with their backs to a wall. Might as well say that they can't make any noise or move at all. What if they are walking around? Do they get a ticket if they are moving buskers that walk up and down the street, they can't avoid every doorway, alleyway, etc if they are walking. 
Here are the types of buskers:
Barely movers. Drawing, painting, musicians - usually need enough room for themselves and their instrument or tools. Need an apron around themselves for people to come into to drop off tips. Need somewhere for the audience to enjoy the sound.
Small scale moving - some painters, chalk artists, musicians that involve the crowd and walk into it, flaming instruments, rodeo style acts, unicycles, some gymnasts, story tellers, rage actors, people that pretend to be statues, most clown acts, pantomime, some jugglers, some hula hoopers, etc.
Large scale moving - lots of gymnasts, some pantomime, jugglers, actors doing scenes, tons of clown/dressed as X acts that will wander up and down streets, most of the acts making balloons, most of the buskers set up by events to advertise what features are around the event - the helpful people with guides that also do a busking show, dancers, martial arts, dragons, marching instruments, etc.

Busking is so dynamic. You can't ask them all to stand against a wall without moving left or right or taking a potty break because they are in costume and might be perceived as busking in a doorway/alleyway/at the crosswalk while crossing.

A better idea would be to ban busking where sidewalks are narrow, allow buskers to be present near businesses if they obtain permission from businesses. and to expressly allow buskers in parks, plazas and other outdoor areas that allow audiences to gather.

There is a huge misunderstanding of what has led that person to busking/panhandling or whatever leables anyone wants to use.  

These are the issues that need to be addressed.  They are somewhat being addressed.  Before citations are given out to anyone who is homeless, housing insecure or the various levels that are given to people who are 'homeless' by other people who are in academics or government or whatever.. it doesn't matter again what labels they are labels.  
Labels are useless unless the underlying issues are being understood and ADRESSED!

These issues that lead to 'homelessness are not being ADDRESSED!

Homelessness comes from somewhere, whether it's family problems, addictions, mental health problems, a combination, rarely a financial issue.  

Yes, there is safety issues with regards to people not in cars in traffic busking.  

I walk in my neighborhood kilometer this evening to go get groceries.  I had a verbal altercation with a man about how he should pay attention because he wasn't watching as I used a lighted crosswalk (that I frequently can't cross without having to yield to cars). I also watched an SUV go in the entrance to the parking lot because she didn't want to turn right on the avenue (there's a sign).  

How about rather than giving citations and warnings to people who have gotten to the place where they are in traffic busking, as a city we address why they are there.  How about we make this city a better place to live and address the underlying issues.  How about as a city if we are really worried about safety we address the safety concerns like the people who shouldn't be driving in the first place!  People who get distracted by a busker, get distracted by pedestrians, by cyclists, by other drivers.  These people shouldn't be driving because it's an accident waiting to happen.

The guidelines defined will effectively eliminate busker and the creativity and life they bring to the street and public. If they need to be 5 m from a business entrance, 15 m from a controlled intersection, 10 m from an alley there is no place they could be on the inside or outside of the sidewalk that would comply with this type of bylaw.

Instead, the City should designate suitable locations on every block for buskers and perhaps (as they do at the farmer's market) have them audition to provide street entertainment.  The City and/or local business association could administrate this and rotate the locations weekly and the performers daily so that no one business has them parked outside continually. Perhaps the City should also provide a stipend to support buskers who enliven the street (LRT station or other public squares) and add entertainment and atmosphere.   

There should be bylaws that limit the decibel level so that excessive sound is not an issue. There also should be safety considerations for buskers to prevent theft.  Perhaps at each location there could be a locked box for public to put change into.

as someone who has had extensive experience in dealing with buskers in the past, i have never found their actions to have put any risk on the safety of the public. not everyone will enjoy the performances of all buskers, but i do believe they bring an important sense of celebration to our city.

having said this, it might be beneficial to put some parameters on what it means to busk. i have seen a number of buskers lately (especially in areas like transit stations) where it's not so much a performance as a display in making noise. we have so many excellent musicians in and performers in the city - where are they hiding out?!",Female,Employed full-time (30+ hours a week),,Public Transit,,Car/truck/van as PASSENGER,,"$150,000 and over",University undergraduate degree,DUGGAN,10,30-34

This is not acceptable behavior especially when the Busker has been asked to move.  I am mostly speaking of restaurants, lounges, and bars which try to create an experience to the establishment whereby the Busker's musical performance does not coincide with the establishment.  Some musically inclined Buskers are very good while others are not and does create altercations with businesses as this affects whether or not a patron will enter the establishment.  As well, I have seen Buskers get into arguments over their ""space"" on the sidewalk which has also led to some bloody altercations.  Considerations should be made for local businesses as the Buskers can hinder or enhance the patrons entering their establishment.  As well, to eliminate the chance of altercations between Buskers, an amendment should be made regarding the distance between Buskers.  To put forth a scenario which did happen on Whyte Avenue with an open air restaurant playing classical background music and had two musically inclined Buskers in close proximity to the restaurant.  Both claimed ""space"" on the block with one playing Bongo drums and the other playing a guitar singing country and western music.  These two Buskers began a competition to outdo the other in volume.  The restaurant manager asked the Buskers to either tone down or leave as this was affecting the restaurant.  An argument ensued and the police were called.  Perhaps an amendment is required to limit the same type of Buskers performing on each street.  For example, you can have a mime, stilt walker, and musician/singer on one block but not more than one type on each block performing at the same time.  The same would go for the LRT stations as there are several Buskers there as well.
